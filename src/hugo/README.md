Hugo Example Blog - A Clone
===========================

This directory contains a copy of the fully-working example blog taken from [https://github.com/spf13/hugo/tree/master/examples/blog](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/tree/master/examples/blog). Many Hugo-specific features are used as a way to see them in action, and hopefully ease the learning curve for creating your
very own site with Hugo.

Features of the Sample Blog
---------------------------

- Recent Posts at main index
- Indexes for `tags` and `categories`
- Post information block, with links for all `tags` and `categories` post belongs to
- [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) ready
  - Currently using the [Yeti](http://bootswatch.com/yeti/) theme from http://bootswatch.com/

Common things that should be added in the near future *(pull requests are welcome!)*:

- Disqus integration
- More content types to demonstrate different layout methods
  - About Me
  - Contact
